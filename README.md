TODO!

-   Run `composer install neo/literay` (this will also install `spatie/laravel-ray`)
-   Run `php artisan ray:publish-config` to publish `ray.php` to your root directory (See documentation)
-   Set the `RAY_PORT` in your env to the port your Laravel application is running on
-   Set the `RAY_HOST` to your applications URL
-   Add `VerifyCsrfToken` to the remove csrf check for the endpoint
-   Check for the route (domain) maybe?
